# VirtualMouse
This project implements a virtual mouse system that allows users to control their computer using only hand gestures via a webcam. Powered by MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and OpenCV for video capture, the system detects specific hand gestures to simulate mouse and keyboard actions â€” enabling a completely touch-free interface.
